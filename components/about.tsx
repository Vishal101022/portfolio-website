              Hey there! I&apos;m Vishal üëã, and I&apos;m all about coding and
              exploring the tech world üíªüåê.
              <br />
              <br />
              My journey into programming began in{" "}
              <span className="underline decoration-sky-500">
                9th grade
              </span>{" "}
              when I first experimented with Java. Ever since I was a kid,
              I&apos;ve been fascinated by all things tech ‚Äì I was that kid who
              couldn&apos;t resist messing around with gadgets and computers.
              Sure, I had a few mishaps along the way (thanks, Dad, for the
              patience!), but those early experiences fueled my curiosity and
              drive to learn more.
              <br />
              <br />I decided to pursue a{" "}
              <span className="underline decoration-sky-500">
                degree in computer science
              </span>{" "}
              , where I got to dive into languages like C++, DSA, and Python. I
              won&apos;t lie ‚Äì mastering them wasn&apos;t a walk in the park.
              But hey, I picked up some valuable skills, especially through my
              freelance gigs on the side.
              <br />
              <br />
              Then came 2020 ‚Äì the year everything turned upside down with the
              Corona pandemic. It made me rethink my path, leading me to pursue
              an{" "}
              <span className="underline decoration-sky-500">MCA degree</span>.
              {" "}
              However, my initial aspirations in{" "}
              <span className="underline decoration-wavy decoration-red-500">
                software engineering
              </span>{" "}
              hit a roadblock when I found DSA less enjoyable.
              <br />
              <br />
              During a summer break, I decided to try something new and signed
              up for the FreeCodeCamp{" "}
              <span className="underline decoration-sky-500">
                Responsive Web Design course.
              </span>{" "}
              And guess what? It clicked! I fell head over heels for{" "}
              <span className="underline decoration-green-500">
                web development
              </span>{" "}
              , and there&apos;s just something magical about seeing your
              creations come to life on the screen.
              <br />
              <br />
              Since then, I&apos;ve been all in,{" "}
              <span className="underline decoration-green-500">
                focusing on JavaScript
              </span>{" "}
              and honing my skills. Now, I&apos;m pumped to bring my expertise
              to the table and help a forward-thinking company crush their goals
              in a full-time role. Let&apos;s make some digital magic happen!
